# Vercel AI Gateway Go SDK — Implementation Plan

## Status legend

- `[ ]` not started
- `[-]` in progress; the active branch/commit must name the chunk
- `[x]` implemented, reviewed, and accepted with the listed checks
- `[!]` blocked; the item must include the blocker, evidence, and the decision needed to unblock it

Only mark a chunk complete after its code, tests, documentation changes, and acceptance checks are in the same reviewable commit. Execute chunks in order. Do not combine chunks or begin a later chunk while an earlier chunk is incomplete.

## Goal

Build a small, maintainable Go port modeled specifically on Vercel's official `ai` / `@ai-sdk/gateway` **provider protocol for evaluation**, not a generic OpenAI-compatible wrapper. The initial SDK must call:

`POST https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v4/ai/evaluation-model`

It must represent the AI SDK Evaluation Model V4 contract: one JSON-compatible shared state, a nonempty keyed question map, boolean/choice/score questions, validated typed answers, warnings, usage, rounding, provider metadata, response metadata, authentication/header behavior, and typed Gateway errors.

The initial release is deliberately narrow. It must not claim parity with the large JavaScript `ai` package or all `@ai-sdk/gateway` modalities.

## Evidence baseline

Planning is pinned to the released upstream behavior observed on 2026-09-20:

- `ai@7.0.107`
- `@ai-sdk/gateway@4.0.87`
- `@ai-sdk/provider@4.0.17`
- `@ai-sdk/provider-utils@5.0.45`
- Evaluation entered core in `ai@7.0.103`; Gateway evaluation entered `@ai-sdk/gateway@4.0.85`.
- The provider base URL is `https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v4/ai`; evaluation posts to `/evaluation-model`.
- The separate public REST API `POST /v1/evaluate` is not the provider protocol and is out of scope.
- Evaluation is experimental and compatibility-sensitive.

## Initial supported surface

### Supported

- AI SDK Gateway provider protocol at `/v4/ai/evaluation-model` only.
- Arbitrary model IDs as strings, including the currently known `typesafe-ai/jev-latest`; model IDs are not a closed enum.
- API-key and OIDC bearer authentication with explicit precedence.
- Optional team scope and caller-supplied headers, with protected protocol/auth headers owned by the SDK.
- Evaluation state that is any JSON-compatible string, object, or array.
- Boolean, choice, and score questions and their discriminated answer forms.
- Exact local validation of requests and responses where the Evaluation Model V4 contract defines invariants.
- Typed HTTP/Gateway errors with safe raw response retention and retry metadata.
- Caller-controlled cancellation through `context.Context`.
- Bounded retry support only where explicitly safe and configured.
- Hermetic tests using `httptest.Server`; separately gated, opt-in live contract checks.

### Explicit non-goals for the initial release

- No OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` or `/v1/responses` wrapper.
- No public `/v1/evaluate` client.
- No language generation, text streaming, embeddings, images, video, reranking, speech, transcription, realtime, batches, credits, spend, generation lookup, model discovery, or gateway-executed search helpers.
- No `generateText`-style orchestration, agents, automatic tool execution, UI helpers, schema framework, or global default-provider registry.
- No full-parity claim with `ai` or `@ai-sdk/gateway`.
- No hard-coded complete model catalog.
- No automatic fallback from an explicitly configured but rejected API key to OIDC.
- No automatic retry of evaluation requests by default; retries may duplicate billable/non-idempotent work.
- No native `x_search` claim through Gateway until a live contract test proves an authenticated, documented wire contract.
- No direct xAI client in the initial Gateway module. Direct xAI Responses support is a separate future feature and package decision, not an alias for Gateway search.

Language generation and streaming are not justified by the evaluation-first goal. They remain excluded rather than adding a second protocol, event model, and error lifecycle before the evaluation contract is stable.

## Fixed architecture and API decisions

### Module and packages

- Module: `github.com/EveGoodEvening/vercel-ai-gateway-go-sdk`
- Root package: `gateway`; public evaluation client and all public contract types.
- Internal package: `internal/httpx`; bounded body reading, header parsing, Retry-After parsing, and shared HTTP response helpers. It must not contain modality policy.
- Internal package: `internal/testserver`; test-only request capture/fixture helpers, imported only by tests.
- Examples: `examples/evaluate/main.go`; runnable only with credentials and never invoked by hermetic tests.

Do not create one package per question type or mirror the JavaScript monorepo hierarchy. Go types and files within `gateway` are sufficient for the initial surface.

### Public client shape

The intended exported API is fixed for implementation review:

```go
package gateway

type Client struct { /* private */ }

type Option func(*clientConfig) error

func NewClient(opts ...Option) (*Client, error)
func WithAPIKey(key string) Option
func WithOIDCToken(token string) Option
func WithOIDCTokenSource(source TokenSource) Option
func WithBaseURL(baseURL string) Option
func WithHTTPClient(client *http.Client) Option
func WithTeam(teamIDOrSlug string) Option
func WithHeaders(headers http.Header) Option
func WithRetryPolicy(policy RetryPolicy) Option

type TokenSource interface {
    Token(context.Context) (string, error)
}

func (c *Client) Evaluate(ctx context.Context, modelID string, req EvaluationRequest) (*EvaluationResult, error)
```

Environment resolution performed by `NewClient`, in strict order:

1. Explicit `WithAPIKey`.
2. `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`.
3. Explicit `WithOIDCToken` or `WithOIDCTokenSource`.
4. `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN`.
5. Otherwise construction fails with a typed configuration error.

The environment API key wins even when an explicit OIDC token or source is configured. An explicit API key always wins, even if the server later rejects it. There is no request-time credential fallback.

Option acceptance and ownership are exact:

- `WithBaseURL` accepts only a nonempty URL string with no leading or trailing Unicode whitespace that parses as an absolute, non-opaque `http` or `https` URL with a nonempty host and no userinfo, query, or fragment. An existing path is allowed. Normalize only by removing every trailing `/` from the path; if that makes the path empty, retain the origin with no trailing slash. Preserve scheme, host, port, escaping, and the remaining path exactly, then append `/evaluation-model`. Do not trim or otherwise repair invalid input.
- `WithHTTPClient` rejects nil. The client stores and uses the supplied pointer; it does not clone or mutate the `http.Client` or its transport. Concurrent safety is therefore the caller's responsibility to the same extent as for `http.Client`.
- `WithAPIKey` and `WithOIDCToken` reject empty or all-Unicode-whitespace values and otherwise preserve the exact string, including leading/trailing whitespace in a nonblank value. `WithOIDCTokenSource` rejects a nil interface and any typed-nil source. Supplying both explicit OIDC forms is last-option-wins; neither can displace an explicit or environment API key under the precedence above. A selected source is called once per HTTP attempt with the Evaluate context; an error, empty token, or all-whitespace token is a request-time `TransportError` and never triggers fallback.
- Environment credential values use the same blank test: blank values are treated as absent; nonblank values are preserved exactly. Missing credentials after precedence resolution is the only credential-selection construction failure.
- `WithTeam` rejects empty or all-Unicode-whitespace values and otherwise preserves the exact string. There is no environment team fallback.
- `WithHeaders(nil)` is valid and means no caller headers. Non-nil input is deep-cloned when the option is applied using `http.Header.Clone`: original key spelling, slice lengths, value order, duplicate values, nil/empty slices, and empty strings are preserved. Later caller mutation cannot affect the client. Each request clones the stored header again, so request construction never mutates stored or caller maps.
- Protected names are matched case-insensitively after `http.CanonicalHeaderKey`: `Authorization`, `Content-Type`, `Ai-Gateway-Protocol-Version`, `Ai-Gateway-Auth-Method`, `Ai-Evaluation-Model-Specification-Version`, `Ai-Model-Id`, and `X-Vercel-Ai-Gateway-Team`. Merely containing a protected key is invalid even when its value slice is nil or empty. Caller headers otherwise preserve all values and are added before the SDK writes its single owned value for every protocol header.

Options are applied in call order and stop at the first error. Every accepted option is copied/stored during `NewClient`; no option retains a caller-owned map or string buffer. `WithRetryPolicy` copies the value struct and follows the fixed normalization below.

### Evaluation type decisions

Use a closed interface implemented by concrete question types so invalid cross-type fields cannot be represented accidentally:

```go
type EvaluationRequest struct {
    State           any
    Questions       map[string]Question
    ProviderOptions map[string]map[string]any
}

type Question interface { questionType() string }
type BooleanQuestion struct {
    Instructions any
    Criteria     *BooleanCriteria
}
type ChoiceQuestion struct {
    Instructions any
    Criteria     map[string]any
}
type ScoreQuestion struct {
    Instructions any
    Criteria     []any
}

// OptionalJSON distinguishes an omitted value from an explicitly present JSON null.
// Set=false omits the containing key and requires Value=nil; Set=true emits Value,
// including nil as JSON null.
type OptionalJSON struct {
    Set   bool
    Value any
}

type BooleanCriteria struct {
    True  OptionalJSON
    False OptionalJSON
}

type EvaluationResult struct {
    Answers          map[string]Answer
    Rounding         *Rounding
    Usage            *Usage
    Warnings         []Warning
    ProviderMetadata map[string]map[string]any
    Response          ResponseMetadata
}

// Rounding reports decimal places used by the provider. A nil field means the
// corresponding wire key was absent; a non-nil pointer may contain zero.
type Rounding struct {
    ProbabilityDecimals *int
    ScoreDecimals       *int
}

// Usage reports token counts. A nil field means the corresponding wire key was
// absent; a non-nil pointer may contain zero. Present counts must be finite,
// non-negative integers representable as int64.
type Usage struct {
    InputTokens  *int64
    OutputTokens *int64
}

type WarningType string

const (
    WarningUnsupported   WarningType = "unsupported"
    WarningCompatibility WarningType = "compatibility"
    WarningDeprecated    WarningType = "deprecated"
    WarningOther         WarningType = "other"
)

// Warning is the lossless public form of one wire warning. Unsupported and
// compatibility warnings require Feature and may set Details; deprecated
// warnings require Setting and Message; other warnings require Message.
// Nil Details distinguishes an omitted details key from an explicitly empty string.
type Warning struct {
    Type    WarningType
    Feature string
    Details *string
    Setting string
    Message string
}

// ResponseMetadata describes the successful HTTP response. ModelID is always
// the caller-supplied model ID, Headers is a clone of the received headers, and
// Body is a defensive copy of the raw successful-response bytes before JSON
// decoding, bounded by the package's fixed 1 MiB response-body limit. Headers
// and Body are non-nil on a successfully read response, including an empty
// body; their zero values mean no response metadata.
type ResponseMetadata struct {
    ModelID string
    Headers http.Header
    Body    []byte
}

type Answer interface { answerType() string }
type BooleanAnswer struct { Probability float64 }
type ChoiceAnswer struct { Choice string; Probabilities map[string]float64 }
type ScoreAnswer struct { Score float64; Probabilities map[string]float64 }

Implementation may use private wire DTOs and custom marshal/unmarshal code. Public data must not expose raw discriminator bookkeeping. Every question requires `Instructions`; `State`, `Instructions`, and every non-null criteria description must be a JSON-compatible string, object, or array. General JSON-compatible values may contain null, booleans, finite numbers, strings, arrays, and string-keyed objects. `ProviderOptions` uses an outer provider-name map whose values must each be a non-nil JSON object; its nested values follow the general JSON rules. All recursive checks happen before network I/O and reject unsupported values, non-string map keys, cycles, NaN, and infinities.

`BooleanQuestion.Criteria == nil` omits `criteria`. A non-nil zero-value `BooleanCriteria{}` emits `{}`. `OptionalJSON{Set:false, Value:nil}` omits that key; `OptionalJSON{Set:true, Value:nil}` emits explicit JSON null; `Set:false` with non-nil `Value` is invalid rather than silently discarded. This presence-bearing API is the sole public representation of boolean criteria presence.

The response wire mapping is fixed. `rounding.probabilityDecimals` and `rounding.scoreDecimals` are optional JSON integer numbers; an absent `rounding` object yields `nil`, while a present empty object yields `&Rounding{}`. `usage.inputTokens` and `usage.outputTokens` are optional JSON integer numbers with the same absent-versus-present-object behavior. `warnings` is optional on the wire and normalizes only absence to a non-nil empty slice; an explicit JSON `null` or malformed warning is invalid. `providerMetadata` is optional and must be an outer string-keyed object whose values are non-null JSON objects; absence yields `nil`, while `{}` remains a non-nil empty map. Warning fields not permitted for their discriminator are rejected rather than discarded. All HTTP bodies share one fixed unexported `1<<20` byte (1 MiB) retained-body limit and are read through a limit-plus-one detector; successful-body overflow or read failure is a `TransportError`, while error-body overflow retains the first 1 MiB and sets `BodyTruncated`. The SDK clones headers and raw bytes when constructing `ResponseMetadata`; because its fields are exported, callers that retain a result must treat their own subsequent mutations as local and must sanitize `Body` before logging or persistence because it can contain echoed state or provider options.

Choice and score answer probability presence is exact: the `probabilities` wire key is optional. If absent, the exported `Probabilities` field is `nil` and distribution/max/weighted-mean checks that require probabilities are skipped. If present, its value must be a non-null JSON object; JSON `null` is invalid, `{}` is invalid, and the object must contain exactly the complete expected key set before sum, maximum, or weighted-mean validation. Decoding never normalizes absent, null, or empty maps into one another. These rules are identical for choice and score answers.

Validation rules:

- Questions are nonempty, IDs are nonempty, and every question has valid required `Instructions`.
- Choice criteria contain at least one option. Returned choice must be known. When the `probabilities` key is present, its map must satisfy the fixed presence/completeness rules above and no other probability may exceed the selected probability by more than the fixed base tolerance `1e-6`; when absent, `Probabilities` is nil and the maximum check is skipped.
- Score criteria contain at least two ordered levels. Returned score is in `[0,n-1]`. When the `probabilities` key is present, its map must satisfy the fixed presence/completeness rules above and the score must equal the probability-weighted mean within the exact tolerance below; when absent, `Probabilities` is nil and the weighted-mean check is skipped.
- Boolean probability is finite and in `[0,1]` and means `P(true)`.
- Every present probability map is complete and contains only expected keys; values are finite in `[0,1]`. An absent map is permitted only for choice and score answers under the rule above; explicit null and empty objects are invalid.
- Let `baseTolerance = 1e-6`. For a declared decimal count `d`, `roundingError(d) = 0.5 * 10^(-d)`; when the count is absent, its rounding error is zero. Decimal counts must be integers in `[0,15]`.
- For a distribution with `k` expected keys, accept its sum iff `abs(sum-1) <= baseTolerance + k*probabilityError`; reject only when strictly greater.
- For score keys `0..n-1`, let `mean = Σ(i*p_i)` and `meanRoundingError = Σ(i*probabilityError)`. Accept iff `abs(mean-score) <= baseTolerance + meanRoundingError + scoreError`; reject only when strictly greater. Missing rounding metadata therefore uses exactly `1e-6` for both sum and mean comparisons.
- Response contains exactly one answer for every question and no unknown answer IDs; answer types match question types.
- Malformed provider output is returned as a response-validation error; it is never normalized silently.

`ValidationError.Path()` uses one canonical grammar for all request validation. The root is `$`. Object/map members append `[` plus a JSON-quoted UTF-8 key plus `]`, using Go `strconv.Quote` semantics (therefore quotes, backslashes, controls, and non-printable code points are escaped deterministically); array/slice elements append `[<base-10 index>]` with no leading zero. Examples are `$["state"]`, `$["questions"]["quality.score"]`, `$["criteria"][0]`, and `$["providerOptions"]["acme"]["a\\\"b"]`. A failure about a container as a whole uses that container's path; a bad map value or array element uses the offending child path. A cycle is reported at the child path whose edge first points to a value already on the active recursion stack, not at the earlier value. Traversal order is struct-defined fields first and otherwise lexicographically sorted string keys; arrays use ascending indexes, so the first returned error is deterministic. Paths describe the public request shape, never private DTO fields.

`ValidationError.Reason()` is one of these exact stable strings and no other value: `required`, `must be nonempty`, `must be a string, object, or array`, `must be JSON-compatible`, `map keys must be strings`, `number must be finite`, `cycle detected`, `must contain at least one option`, `must contain at least two levels`, `must be a non-nil question`, `question type is unsupported`, `must be omitted when Set is false`, or `must be a non-nil object`. Use `required` for absent/nil required values (including instructions); `must be nonempty` for empty model/question IDs or the empty questions map; `must be a string, object, or array` for a JSON-compatible scalar/null where the input-only restricted shape is required; `must be JSON-compatible` for unsupported Go values such as funcs/channels/complex values; `map keys must be strings` at the offending map container; `number must be finite` at NaN/Inf; `cycle detected` under the rule above; the two cardinality reasons at their criteria containers; `must be a non-nil question` at a nil question entry; `question type is unsupported` at an unknown implementation; `must be omitted when Set is false` at the offending `OptionalJSON` member; and `must be a non-nil object` at a nil provider object. Exact compatibility applies to `Path` and `Reason`; human-readable `Error()` prose is not a compatibility surface.

`ResponseValidationError.Path()` uses the same `$` plus JSON-quoted member/index grammar as `ValidationError`; paths name wire-response locations, not Go fields. The fixed top-level response members are `$["answers"]`, `$["rounding"]`, `$["usage"]`, `$["warnings"]`, and `$["providerMetadata"]`. Answer failures use `$["answers"][<question ID>]`; discriminator/value fields append `["type"]`, `["probability"]`, `["choice"]`, `["score"]`, or `["probabilities"]`, and probability entries append their choice/decimal score key. Rounding uses `["probabilityDecimals"]`/`["scoreDecimals"]`; usage uses `["inputTokens"]`/`["outputTokens"]`; warning fields use `$["warnings"][<index>][<field>]`; provider metadata uses `$["providerMetadata"][<provider>]` and then its nested JSON member/index path. A missing required member or missing expected answer/probability key uses the path where that member should have appeared. An extra/unknown/forbidden member uses its actual child path. A whole-container invariant uses the container path. JSON syntax errors and trailing JSON values use `$`; duplicate keys use the path of the duplicated key in the innermost object being decoded.

`ResponseValidationError.Reason()` is one of these exact stable strings and no other value: `malformed JSON`, `trailing JSON value`, `duplicate field`, `unknown field`, `required`, `must be an object`, `must be an array`, `must be a string`, `must be a number`, `must be an integer`, `must be non-null`, `must be nonempty`, `number must be finite`, `must be between 0 and 1`, `must be between 0 and 15`, `answer is missing`, `answer is unexpected`, `answer type does not match question`, `answer type is unsupported`, `choice is not in criteria`, `probability key is missing`, `probability key is unexpected`, `probabilities must sum to 1 within tolerance`, `selected choice is not maximal`, `score is out of range`, `score does not match weighted mean`, `warning type is unsupported`, `field is forbidden for warning type`, or `must be a non-nil object`. Use the structural reasons before semantic validation: null uses `must be non-null` except a provider-metadata provider value uses `must be a non-nil object`; a wrong JSON kind uses the corresponding `must be ...`; absent required wire fields use `required`. Empty present probability objects use `must be nonempty`. Missing/extra answer IDs and probability keys use their dedicated reasons. Integer range, probability range, score range, distribution, maximum, and weighted-mean failures use the dedicated reasons above.

Response JSON decoding is strict and finite. `Evaluate(nil, ...)` returns `ValidationError` at `$["context"]` with `required` before credential-source or transport work. Only HTTP status `200` is successful; every other status, including other `2xx` values, is a `ResponseError`. Response `Content-Type` is not enforced because intermediaries may omit or rewrite it. A status-200 body must contain exactly one JSON value followed only by JSON whitespace. Duplicate object keys are rejected throughout the entire response, including answer/probability/provider maps and recursively nested provider metadata. Unknown fields are rejected at every fixed DTO level: top-level result, each answer variant, `rounding`, `usage`, and each warning variant. The only intentionally open objects are the answer map, probability maps, provider-name map, and recursively JSON-compatible provider metadata values; openness does not waive duplicate-key, key-set, or value invariants. No decoder silently accepts a second value, duplicate key, or forward-compatible unknown fixed field.

### Provider wire contract

Every evaluation request uses:

- `POST {baseURL}/evaluation-model`
- Default base URL `https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v4/ai`, normalized without a trailing slash.
- `Authorization: Bearer <credential>`
- `Content-Type: application/json`
- `ai-gateway-protocol-version: 0.0.1`
- `ai-gateway-auth-method: api-key` or `oidc`
- `ai-evaluation-model-specification-version: 4`
- `ai-model-id: <modelID>`
- Optional `x-vercel-ai-gateway-team`.

The JSON body contains `state`, `questions`, and `providerOptions` only. It does not contain `model`. Preserve an explicitly supplied empty provider-options object; omit provider options only when nil. User headers may add values but may not override Authorization, content type, model/spec/protocol/auth-method, or team headers.

### Errors and retries

The exported retry API is fixed:

```go
type RetryPolicy struct {
    MaxAttempts  int
    InitialDelay time.Duration
    MaxDelay     time.Duration
    Multiplier   float64
    Jitter       float64
}
```

`MaxAttempts` counts the initial request. `0` and `1` both mean exactly one attempt and no retry; retries occur only for values `2..10`. When retries are enabled, zero `InitialDelay`, `MaxDelay`, or `Multiplier` resolve respectively to `100*time.Millisecond`, `2*time.Second`, and `2`; `Jitter==0` means no jitter. Explicit values require `InitialDelay` in `[time.Millisecond, time.Minute]`, `MaxDelay` in `[time.Millisecond, 5*time.Minute]` and not below the resolved initial delay, `Multiplier` in `[1,10]`, and `Jitter` in `[0,1]`; negative durations, negative attempts, attempts above 10, NaN/infinite floats, and nonzero values outside those ranges make `NewClient` return a `ConfigurationError` from applying `WithRetryPolicy`. Backoff before retry number `r` (where the first retry is `r=1`) is `min(MaxDelay, InitialDelay*Multiplier^(r-1))`, computed with saturation rather than overflowing. If jitter is nonzero and the private jitter hook returns `u` in `[0,1)`, the delay becomes `delay * (1 + Jitter*(2*u-1))`, rounded to the nearest `time.Duration` nanosecond and capped again at `MaxDelay`. A valid `Retry-After` replaces the computed/jittered backoff and is capped at `MaxDelay`; malformed or negative `Retry-After` is treated as absent. All durations are Go `time.Duration`. Waiting is context-cancellable.

Retry test control is private: `clientConfig` contains an unexported `retryHooks` value with `now func() time.Time`, `sleep func(context.Context, time.Duration) error`, and `jitter func() float64`; production defaults are `time.Now`, a timer-based context-aware sleeper, and a concurrency-safe uniform source in `[0,1)`. Package-internal tests may install hooks through an unexported `withRetryHooks(retryHooks) Option`; tests may return `0` or the largest representable value below `1` to cover the jitter bounds. No clock, sleeper, random source, or hook is exported.

Export this exact error hierarchy, compatible with `errors.As`; all data fields are private so zero/safety semantics cannot be bypassed:

```go
type ConfigurationError struct { /* private */ }
func (e *ConfigurationError) Error() string
func (e *ConfigurationError) Option() string
func (e *ConfigurationError) Reason() string

type ValidationError struct { /* private */ }
func (e *ValidationError) Error() string
func (e *ValidationError) Path() string
func (e *ValidationError) Reason() string

type TransportError struct { /* private */ }
func (e *TransportError) Error() string
func (e *TransportError) Operation() string
func (e *TransportError) Unwrap() error

type ResponseError struct { /* private */ }
func (e *ResponseError) Error() string
func (e *ResponseError) Unwrap() error
func (e *ResponseError) StatusCode() int
func (e *ResponseError) Message() string
func (e *ResponseError) Type() string
func (e *ResponseError) Code() string
func (e *ResponseError) Param() any
func (e *ResponseError) GenerationID() string
func (e *ResponseError) RequestID() string
func (e *ResponseError) ResponseID() string
func (e *ResponseError) RetryAfter() (time.Duration, bool)
func (e *ResponseError) Retryable() bool
func (e *ResponseError) BodyTruncated() bool
func (e *ResponseError) RawResponseBody() []byte

type ResponseValidationError struct { /* private */ }
func (e *ResponseValidationError) Error() string
func (e *ResponseValidationError) Unwrap() error
func (e *ResponseValidationError) StatusCode() int
func (e *ResponseValidationError) Path() string
func (e *ResponseValidationError) Reason() string
func (e *ResponseValidationError) RequestID() string
func (e *ResponseValidationError) ResponseID() string
func (e *ResponseValidationError) BodyTruncated() bool
func (e *ResponseValidationError) RawResponseBody() []byte
```

`ConfigurationError` replaces the previously provisional name `ConfigError`; no alias is provided. `Option`, `Path`, `Reason`, `Operation`, envelope strings, and IDs return `""` when unavailable. A string wire `error.code` is returned unchanged; a numeric code is returned in its original JSON lexical form; absent or null code returns `""`. `Param` returns nil for absent/null and otherwise a recursively defensive-copied JSON-compatible value on every call. The known error envelope is `{ "error": { "message", "type", "code", "param" }, "generationId", "requestId", "responseId" }`; IDs are read only from those top-level JSON string fields, so missing or mistyped IDs remain empty and no undocumented header is reinterpreted as an ID. `StatusCode` returns `0` before an HTTP response exists; `ResponseError` always has a positive HTTP status, and `ResponseValidationError` always has status 200. `RetryAfter` returns `(0,false)` when absent or invalid and `(0,true)` only for a valid header whose computed remaining delay is zero; `Retryable` is the final status/type classification and is false for a zero value. `BodyTruncated` is false unless bytes were actually omitted by the fixed 1 MiB limit. `RawResponseBody` returns `nil` when no body was retained and otherwise a fresh defensive copy on every call. `Unwrap` returns the underlying cause or nil; configuration and validation errors do not wrap causes. Nil receivers for every accessor return the documented zero value, `Unwrap` returns nil, `Param` and `RawResponseBody` return nil, and `Error` returns the stable type phrase (`"gateway configuration error"`, `"gateway validation error"`, `"gateway transport error"`, `"gateway response error"`, or `"gateway response validation error"`) without panicking.

`ConfigurationError.Option()` has this closed value set: `WithBaseURL`, `WithHTTPClient`, `WithAPIKey`, `WithOIDCToken`, `WithOIDCTokenSource`, `WithTeam`, `WithHeaders`, `WithRetryPolicy`, or `credentials`. `ConfigurationError.Reason()` has this closed value set: `must not be empty or whitespace`, `must be an absolute http or https URL`, `must not contain userinfo, query, or fragment`, `must not be nil`, `contains protected header`, `invalid MaxAttempts`, `invalid InitialDelay`, `invalid MaxDelay`, `MaxDelay is less than InitialDelay`, `invalid Multiplier`, `invalid Jitter`, or `no credential configured`. URL parse failures, relative/opaque URLs, missing hosts, and non-HTTP(S) schemes map to `WithBaseURL`/`must be an absolute http or https URL`; userinfo/query/fragment maps to the other base-URL reason. Blank explicit credentials/team and blank base URL map to their option and `must not be empty or whitespace`. Nil HTTP clients and nil/typed-nil token sources map to their option and `must not be nil`. Any protected header maps to `WithHeaders`/`contains protected header`. Retry fields map to the named field reason, with the cross-field comparison using `MaxDelay is less than InitialDelay`. Exhausted credential resolution maps to `credentials`/`no credential configured`. No other pair is emitted.

`TransportError.Operation()` has this closed value set: `resolve OIDC token`, `encode request`, `create request`, `send request`, or `read response body`. A selected token source error or blank returned token maps to `resolve OIDC token`; JSON marshaling after successful validation maps to `encode request`; `http.NewRequestWithContext` failure maps to `create request`; and `http.Client.Do`, including context cancellation/deadline while sending or awaiting headers, maps to `send request`. The Chunk 04 raw helper captures response status and headers before reading the body and returns them together with any bounded-body read, overflow, or close error. Public `Client.Evaluate` maps such a failure for status 200 to `TransportError("read response body")`; for every non-200 status, Chunk 06 instead returns a `ResponseError` retaining that status and wrapping a `TransportError("read response body")` as its cause. The underlying source/context/HTTP/body error remains reachable through `Unwrap`; a blank source token wraps a private sentinel rather than a configuration error. No other operation string is emitted.

`Error()` and any `fmt.Formatter` implementation must never include raw response bytes, authorization values, caller-header values, state, provider options, or other credential material. The diagnostic Go documentation on both `RawResponseBody` methods must state that an upstream or intermediary may have echoed sensitive request state or provider options and that callers must sanitize before logging or persistence. Structured safe fields may appear in error strings. Tests must treat `%s`, `%v`, `%+v`, `%q`, nil receivers, and wrapped-error formatting as public disclosure surfaces.

Retry classification is the exact status-only predicate `status == 408 || status == 409 || status == 429 || (status >= 500 && status <= 599)`. Parsed or malformed `error.type` and `error.code` never add, remove, or override retryability. `ResponseError.Retryable()` returns exactly that predicate for its HTTP status, including when the body is empty, malformed, truncated, or unreadable; a nil/zero-value error returns false. `Evaluate` retries a `ResponseError` if and only if `Retryable()` is true, the resolved policy has another attempt, the response body was read successfully, and the context remains active. A non-200 `ResponseError` that wraps a body read/overflow/close `TransportError` is therefore never retried even when its preserved status is otherwise retryable. Thus all other statuses, including 400, 401, 402, 403, and 404, are non-retryable. Honor both Retry-After seconds and HTTP dates using the injected `now` hook, but Retry-After never makes a non-retryable status retryable. Default maximum attempts is one. A caller opting into retries accepts duplicate evaluation risk; context cancellation stops waits and attempts immediately.
## Assumptions and risks

1. **Experimental upstream protocol:** patch releases may change Evaluation Model V4. Pin fixture evidence to upstream versions and record protocol changes before adapting.
2. **No live request evidence yet:** source/tests establish the shape, but an authenticated live smoke is required before release candidate tagging.
3. **Authentication environment:** OIDC token refresh semantics vary. The token-source interface prevents freezing an expiring token into a long-lived client.
4. **Arbitrary JSON in Go:** `any` is ergonomic but needs strict recursive validation and deterministic error paths.
5. **Floating-point probabilities:** use the fixed upstream-compatible `1e-6` base tolerance plus declared half-unit-in-last-place errors exactly as specified above; boundary comparisons are inclusive and provider values are never renormalized.
6. **Error-body drift and sensitivity:** parse known fields and retain bounded raw bytes for explicit diagnostics, but never include them in error formatting because providers or intermediaries may echo sensitive request data.
7. **Model catalog drift:** accept arbitrary nonempty model IDs. Examples may use `typesafe-ai/jev-latest`, but the API must not imply it is the only model.
8. **Retry billing/duplication:** evaluation is not known to be idempotent. Zero retries is the safe default.
9. **Repository publication:** there is currently no remote, license choice, or release history. Release remains blocked until ownership chooses a license and configures a remote.
10. **`x_search`:** direct xAI Responses and `@ai-sdk/xai` support it, but Gateway support is unconfirmed. Do not infer support from a model's generic `tools` capability.

## Dependency-ordered implementation checklist

### Chunk 01 — Module and public contract skeleton

**Commit boundary:** `chore: initialize evaluation SDK module`

- [x] Create `go.mod` with module `github.com/EveGoodEvening/vercel-ai-gateway-go-sdk` and `go 1.26`, meaning an exact minimum language/toolchain compatibility floor of Go 1.26.0, and document that floor in `README.md`. The initial support window is the maintained Go 1.26 and 1.27 families; CI is pinned to Go 1.26.8 and Go 1.27.1 as observed on 2026-09-20.
- [x] Create `doc.go` declaring package `gateway` and its evaluation-only scope.
- [x] Create `client.go` with `Client`, private `clientConfig`, `Option`, `NewClient`, option declarations, the exact exported `RetryPolicy`, its `WithRetryPolicy` validation/default resolution, and private `retryHooks`/`withRetryHooks`; options may validate/store configuration but must not perform network calls.
- [x] Create `evaluation.go` with every public request/result/question/answer/metadata declaration fixed above, including warning constants, pointer optionality, nested provider metadata, and successful-response copy/zero semantics.
- [x] Create `errors.go` with exactly `ConfigurationError`, `ValidationError`, `TransportError`, `ResponseError`, and `ResponseValidationError` plus every fixed accessor, nil-receiver zero behavior, safe `Error`, and specified `Unwrap` behavior, without HTTP envelope decoding yet. Do not add `ConfigError`, exported fields, constructors, aliases, or alternate accessors.
- [x] Create `README.md` with an explicit supported/non-goal matrix and experimental status; do not publish a usage example that cannot run yet.
- [x] Add license only after repository ownership selects it; until then add a release blocker in the README rather than guessing.

**Acceptance checks:**

- [x] `go test ./...` compiles the public skeleton without network access.
- [x] `go vet ./...` succeeds.
- [x] `go doc .` shows only the intended evaluation-first skeleton surface and no parity claim; it is not required to show `Client.Evaluate` before Chunk 06.
- [x] A package-external compile test locks the exported declarations and method signatures available in this skeleton commit for metadata, retry policy, options, and all five error types; `Client.Evaluate` is added and compile-locked in Chunk 06 once both its success and non-200 paths are complete. A package-internal test locks nil/zero accessor behavior, the closed `ConfigurationError` and `TransportError` accessor value sets, and confirms the retry hooks remain unexported.
- [x] Independent review after fixes was clean and confirms no `/v1` OpenAI client, language API, or tool executor was introduced.

### Chunk 02 — JSON-compatible input model and request validation

**Commit boundary:** `feat: validate evaluation requests`

- [x] Create `jsonvalue.go` implementing cycle-safe recursive JSON compatibility checks with the exact `$`/JSON-quoted-key/index path grammar, deterministic traversal, cycle-edge rule, and canonical reason vocabulary fixed above; include a distinct input validator that accepts only JSON-compatible strings, objects, or arrays.
- [x] Create `evaluation_validate.go` implementing model ID, state, required question instructions, question ID/criteria, `OptionalJSON` invariants, and provider-options validation; reject nil/non-object outer provider values before transport.
- [x] Add custom/private wire encoding in `evaluation_wire.go` for discriminated question JSON and the specified boolean criteria omission/empty-object/explicit-null behavior.
- [x] Add `evaluation_validate_test.go` covering all three valid question types; required string/object/array instructions; missing instructions and scalar/null/invalid nested instructions; nested state; arrays as one shared state; empty questions; invalid IDs; too-short criteria; `OptionalJSON{Set:false}` with a non-nil value; nil outer provider-option objects and invalid nested provider-option values; non-string map keys; channels/functions; cycles; NaN; and infinities. Assert `errors.As` to `*ValidationError` and exact canonical `Path`/`Reason` values, including root `$`, JSON-quoted escaping for punctuation/quotes/backslashes/control characters, map keys, array indexes, the first active-stack cycle edge, sorted-map determinism, non-string-key maps, and every canonical reason.
- [x] Add `evaluation_wire_test.go` asserting exact observable JSON bodies, including required `instructions`, nil versus empty `providerOptions`, omitted boolean criteria, an empty criteria object, true-only explicit null, false-only explicit null, both explicit null, and non-null values for both keys. Cover normalization of byte slices, `json.Number`, named primitive types, and value- and pointer-receiver custom JSON marshalers so encoder-specific behavior cannot change the validated wire shape.

**Acceptance checks:**

- [x] `gofmt` reports no formatting changes for the Chunk 02 Go files.
- [x] `go test ./...` succeeds with no network access.
- [x] `go test -race ./...` succeeds.
- [x] Independent post-fix review was clean.

### Chunk 03 — Authentication, configuration, and protected headers

**Commit boundary:** `feat: configure gateway authentication and headers`

- [ ] Complete `client.go` options and deterministic environment resolution in the exact fixed order: explicit API key, environment API key, explicit OIDC token/source, environment OIDC.
- [ ] Create `auth.go` implementing API-key/OIDC credential selection and the `TokenSource` request-time callback.
- [ ] Create `headers.go` implementing required provider headers, team scope, caller headers, and protected-header rejection.
- [ ] Add `auth_test.go` covering pure construction-time credential selection: explicit API key, environment API key, explicit OIDC token/source, environment OIDC, missing credentials, blank explicit/environment credentials, nil/typed-nil token sources, last-option-wins between explicit OIDC forms, and API-key precedence. Include separate cases that an environment API key selects over an explicit OIDC token and source without invoking the source. Assert every construction failure's exact `ConfigurationError.Option`/`Reason`. Request-time source invocation/errors and fallback observations belong only to Chunk 04.
- [ ] Add `headers_test.go` covering the pure header builder and option ownership: exact protected-name set, case-insensitive rejection including nil/empty values, nil input, multi-value/order preservation, defensive copy at option application and per-request clone, team validation, and every exact `ConfigurationError.Option`/`Reason`. Exact outbound observation belongs only to Chunk 04.

**Acceptance checks:**

- [ ] `go test ./...` and `go test -race ./...` succeed hermetically using only construction-time and pure helper tests for this chunk.
- [ ] Tests prove credential precedence, option acceptance/copy semantics, protected-header rejection, and the closed `ConfigurationError` value mapping without constructing or sending an HTTP request.

### Chunk 04 — Raw HTTP transport and evaluation request execution

**Commit boundary:** `feat: send evaluation model requests`

- [ ] Create `transport.go` with a private raw evaluation execution helper that accepts an already validated/encoded request payload, builds a context-bound `POST {baseURL}/evaluation-model` request, resolves the selected credential for that attempt, applies caller and SDK-owned headers, executes through the injected/default `http.Client`, captures status and cloned headers before body consumption, closes the response body, and returns one internal raw-response outcome containing status, headers, the bounded bytes/prefix and truncation state, plus any bounded-body read/overflow/close error. Once headers exist, that error is carried in the outcome rather than returned as the helper's top-level error, so later policy can preserve HTTP status. The model travels only in `ai-model-id`. This helper owns transport, authentication-attempt, header, and raw request/response behavior; it must not decode or validate an `EvaluationResult`, choose the public error type for a received response, or expose a new public API.
- [ ] Create `internal/httpx/body.go` with the fixed unexported 1 MiB response-body limit, limit-plus-one detection, status-neutral bounded bytes/prefix and truncation reporting, and preservation of read/overflow/close causes. HTTP status policy and public error construction remain outside `internal/httpx`.
- [ ] Create `internal/testserver/server.go` for exact request capture in tests only.
- [ ] Create a test-only hermetic transport guard used by ordinary tests: it must reject every destination whose resolved request URL host is not loopback (`localhost`, a loopback IP, or the active `httptest.Server` loopback address), fail closed on unparsable/empty hosts, and never delegate rejected requests. Ordinary tests must scrub `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`, `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN`, and the live-evaluation cost acknowledgement `AI_GATEWAY_LIVE_COST_ACK` before client construction.
- [ ] Add `evaluation_transport_test.go` using `httptest.Server` and a recording transport to exercise the private raw execution helper directly and verify path, method, exact headers/body, all base-URL acceptance and normalization cases, injected HTTP client, context cancellation, bounded body reading, and body closure. For both status 200 and non-200 responses, assert that status and headers survive body read, overflow, and close failures in the internal outcome; do not assert a public `TransportError` or `ResponseError` for a received response in this chunk. This file owns the deferred observable transport checks from Chunk 03: selected token sources are called once per attempt; source errors/blank tokens produce `TransportError("resolve OIDC token")`; API-key selection never invokes or falls back to an OIDC source; caller header maps are not mutated; the exact protected/SDK-owned header set is emitted; and concurrent raw executions through one client, including a token source, are race-free. Request-validation ordering, nil-context behavior, successful result decoding, and public `Client.Evaluate` composition belong to Chunks 05–06.

**Acceptance checks:**

- [ ] `go test ./...` and `go test -race ./...` succeed under the non-loopback-rejecting guard with `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`, `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN`, and `AI_GATEWAY_LIVE_COST_ACK` unset; no test calls the public `Client.Evaluate` method in this chunk.
- [ ] Targeted tests prove a loopback server remains usable while the default live Gateway host is rejected without a network attempt; request-time token-source failures occur before transport observation; and API-key selection performs no source call or fallback.
- [ ] Targeted recording tests prove the exact outbound protected/required headers, caller-header non-mutation, encoded request body with no `model` field, and `ai-model-id` containing the arbitrary requested model string.
- [ ] Targeted tests prove every fixed pre-response `TransportError.Operation` mapping owned by raw execution, observe `context.Canceled` through the `send request` error chain, prove received-response body failures preserve status/headers and their underlying cause in the internal outcome, and exercise concurrent raw executions/token-source access under the race detector.

### Chunk 05 — Response decoding and contract validation

**Commit boundary:** `feat: decode and validate evaluation results`

- [ ] Add private response DTOs and discriminated answer decoding to `evaluation_wire.go`.
- [ ] Complete `evaluation_validate.go` with exact answer-set/type checks, the fixed absent-versus-present probability semantics, choice maxima, score ranges/weighted means, finite probability checks, complete probability key sets, rounding validation, and the fixed `1e-6`/half-unit-in-last-place formulas above.
- [ ] Add a private successful-response composition function in `evaluation.go`: given caller model ID, original validated questions, and a successfully read status-200 raw outcome from Chunk 04, strictly decode the bounded raw body, validate the decoded result against the original questions, and return the completed `EvaluationResult`. Keep request validation, transport invocation, status dispatch, and public error selection for the sole public `Client.Evaluate` composition point in Chunk 06; introduce no duplicate HTTP/auth/header logic.
- [ ] Decode the exact metadata wire contract: preserve absent versus present-empty `Rounding`/`Usage`, require optional counts to be valid integers, validate warning discriminator-specific required/forbidden fields, preserve nil versus empty `ProviderMetadata`, clone response headers, retain bounded raw successful-response bytes, and set the caller's model ID in `ResponseMetadata`.
- [ ] Normalize only an absent warnings key to a non-nil empty slice; reject explicit null, malformed warnings, forbidden warning fields, malformed metadata, and invalid integer/count forms rather than repairing them.
- [ ] Add `evaluation_response_test.go` for the private status-200 response composition and contract: cover valid boolean/choice/score results, mixed questions, unknown provider-metadata preservation, every metadata absent/present-empty/present-zero case, all four warning variants and invalid field combinations, cloned headers/body, missing/extra answers, wrong types, invalid choices/scores/probabilities, ties, weighted means, rounding decimal validity and boundaries 0 and 15, malformed JSON, trailing JSON, duplicate keys, and unknown fields at every fixed DTO level. Assert Content-Type is ignored. Assert the exact `ResponseValidationError.Path`/`Reason` mapping for malformed JSON, answer coverage/types/probabilities, warnings, rounding, usage, and provider metadata. Public request-ordering, status dispatch, and body-read failure assertions belong to Chunk 06.

**Acceptance checks:**

- [ ] `go test ./...` and `go test -race ./...` succeed with private successful-response decoding and validation complete; the public `Client.Evaluate` method is not implemented or called yet.
- [ ] Tests prove a successfully read status-200 raw outcome composes strict decoding and response validation without duplicating transport behavior.
- [ ] Tests prove every request question receives exactly one matching typed answer.
- [ ] Tests prove the implementation uses the specified formulas and strict-`>` rejection comparisons, including the default `1e-6` tolerance when rounding metadata is absent.
- [ ] Tests prove malformed provider output yields `ResponseValidationError` with the exact status/path/reason/ID accessors, bounded defensively copied raw body, truncation flag, nil-safe zero semantics, and safe formatting.
### Chunk 06 — Typed Gateway errors and response diagnostics

**Commit boundary:** `feat: expose typed gateway errors`

- [ ] Create `response_error.go` to parse known Gateway error envelopes into the fixed private `ResponseError` representation while retaining unknown bounded raw bodies only behind `RawResponseBody`; it also owns construction of every non-200 `ResponseError`, including outcomes whose body could not be completely read.
- [ ] Create `internal/httpx/retry_after.go` to parse delta-seconds and HTTP-date Retry-After values against the injected `now` hook and return presence separately from a zero duration.
- [ ] Populate every fixed `ResponseError` accessor: status, message, type, code, param, generation ID, request ID, response ID, Retry-After presence/value, the exact status-only retry predicate (with type/code explicitly ignored), truncation, cause, and defensive raw-body copy.
- [ ] Implement, document, and compile-lock the public `Client.Evaluate` method in `evaluation.go` as the sole composition point: validate the non-nil context, model ID, and complete request before any credential-source or transport work; encode the validated wire request; invoke Chunk 04's private raw helper; dispatch on the captured status; map a status-200 body read/overflow/close failure to `TransportError("read response body")`; pass a successfully read status-200 outcome to Chunk 05 decoding; and map every non-200 outcome to `ResponseError`. A non-200 body read/overflow/close failure must retain the positive status and headers, wrap a `TransportError("read response body")` reachable through `ResponseError.Unwrap`/`errors.Is`, retain only the bounded bytes actually captured, and remain ineligible for retry by `Evaluate`.
- [ ] Handle empty bodies, invalid JSON, upstream provider-shaped bodies, oversized bodies, and body-read failures without hiding the HTTP status. Parsing is attempted only when the non-200 body was read successfully; a failed read produces no invented envelope fields, while the body-read cause remains reachable through `Unwrap`/`errors.Is`.
- [ ] Add `response_error_test.go` covering public `Client.Evaluate` request ordering and status dispatch; the zero value and nil receiver; boundary statuses 407/408/409/410, 428/429/430, 499/500/599/600 plus 400, 401, 402, 403, and 404; known/unknown envelopes; retryable statuses carrying arbitrary known/unknown type/code values; non-retryable statuses carrying the same values; valid zero, malformed, negative, seconds, and HTTP-date Retry-After; proof that Retry-After does not alter classification; all IDs; missing fields; truncation; a fresh defensive copy per raw-body accessor call; and `errors.As`/`errors.Is`. Include response bodies echoing unique secret markers from request `state` and `providerOptions`. Assert nil context and every invalid request fail before credential/transport observation, only status 200 enters Chunk 05 decoding, status-200 body read/overflow/close failures are `TransportError("read response body")`, and non-200 equivalents are status-preserving `ResponseError` values unwrapping that `TransportError`.
**Acceptance checks:**

- [ ] `go test ./...` and `go test -race ./...` succeed hermetically with the public `Client.Evaluate` method now complete and package-external compile coverage locking its fixed signature; `go doc .` shows the documented method on `Client` for the first time.
- [ ] Tests prove `ResponseError.Retryable()` is true exactly for 408, 409, 429, and 500–599 and false otherwise, independent of `error.type`, `error.code`, Retry-After, or body parseability; tests also prove that a non-200 body-read/overflow/close failure carries an internal read-failure cause that Chunk 07 can deterministically exclude from retries.
- [ ] Secret markers and raw-body text are absent from `Error()`, `%s`, `%v`, `%+v`, `%q`, and wrapped-error output, while the accessor retains the bounded bytes; authorization and caller-header values are absent from the same surfaces.

### Chunk 07 — Opt-in bounded retry policy

**Commit boundary:** `feat: add opt-in evaluation retries`

- [ ] Create `retry.go` using the fixed `RetryPolicy` normalization, bounds, attempt-count units, exponential formula, symmetric jitter, `MaxDelay` caps, and Retry-After replacement semantics; use only private `retryHooks` for deterministic tests.
- [ ] Retry only errors classified retryable and only when resolved `MaxAttempts` is greater than one; `RetryPolicy{}` and `MaxAttempts:1` each send exactly one attempt.
- [ ] Never retry request validation, response validation, authentication/configuration, context cancellation, body-read/overflow/close failures, or non-retryable statuses. For a `ResponseError`, test the preserved internal body-read-failure cause before applying its status-only `Retryable()` result, so an unreadable 408/409/429/5xx response deterministically stops while a fully read response at the same status may retry.
- [ ] Ensure request bodies are recreated for every attempt and token sources are consulted per attempt.
- [ ] Add `retry_test.go` with private fake hooks covering every default and validation boundary, attempt counts 0/1/2/10 and rejection of negative/11, exact exponential delays, multiplier overflow-safe capping, deterministic jitter endpoints, Retry-After absent/zero/seconds/date/malformed/negative and cap behavior, cancellation during wait, credential refresh, exhaustion, and no retries after a valid HTTP 200 with invalid evaluation output. Add separate status-200 and non-200 body read/overflow/close cases; for non-200 include otherwise retryable 408, 409, 429, and 5xx statuses and assert one attempt, preserved `ResponseError.StatusCode`, and the wrapped `TransportError("read response body")`.

**Acceptance checks:**

- [ ] `go test ./...` and `go test -race ./...` succeed without real sleeping.
- [ ] Tests prove both zero-value policy and `MaxAttempts:1` send exactly one request for a retryable 500, and all sleeps are observed through private hooks with no real sleeping.
- [ ] Public docs state the exact retry field units/defaults/bounds and that opt-in retries may duplicate billable evaluation work.

### Chunk 08 — Document the native `x_search` unsupported decision

**Commit boundary:** `docs: record x search gateway support decision`

This documentation-only chunk is completeable without credentials and does not create an x_search test or implementation.

- [ ] Create `docs/x-search.md` documenting confirmed direct-xAI behavior: `POST https://api.x.ai/v1/responses`, top-level `tools:[{type:"x_search", ...}]`, snake_case options, provider-executed `x_search_call`, and direct `@ai-sdk/xai` support.
- [ ] Document that current `@ai-sdk/gateway@4.0.87` has no `xSearch` helper and public Gateway `/v1` docs do not establish native xAI `x_search` support.
- [ ] Record the evidence-review date, cited upstream versions/sources, and the release decision: Gateway-native `x_search` is unsupported and all exported x_search APIs remain absent.
- [ ] State that generic model tool capability is insufficient evidence and that only a future reviewed plan backed by a first-party Gateway wire contract and authenticated native-tool evidence may change the decision.

**Acceptance checks:**

- [ ] `go test ./...` remains credential-free and contains no Gateway x_search probe.
- [ ] Repository search and API review find no exported x_search API or unsupported implementation claim.
- [ ] The README support matrix and `docs/x-search.md` consistently say Gateway-native x_search is unsupported/unconfirmed while distinguishing direct xAI facts.

**Future blocked item — outside chunks 01–12 and not a release prerequisite:** `[!]` An authenticated Gateway-native x_search probe may be planned only after first-party documentation supplies the Gateway endpoint, protocol/request schema, native response evidence shape, and a suitable explicit model ID. Before execution it must additionally define credential variables, a dedicated cost-acknowledgement variable, sanitization rules, and success criteria that require native `x_search_call` evidence rather than generated text. Until every prerequisite exists, do not create a placeholder/skipping test, invent a request, or block the evaluation release.

### Chunk 09 — Credentialed evaluation contract smoke

**Commit boundary:** `test: add gated evaluation contract smoke`

- [ ] Create `internal/livecontract/evaluation_test.go` behind build tag `livecontract`. Require `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` or `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN` and require the exact cost acknowledgement `AI_GATEWAY_LIVE_COST_ACK=I_ACCEPT_LIVE_EVALUATION_COSTS`; any other value is unacknowledged.
- [ ] Exercise the public `Client.Evaluate` API against the default `/v4/ai/evaluation-model` endpoint with `typesafe-ai/jev-latest` and one request containing boolean, choice, and score questions over a shared state.
- [ ] Assert contract properties rather than subjective answer wording: three matching typed answers; finite valid probabilities/scores; exact `ResponseMetadata.ModelID`; non-nil cloned headers and bounded body; and any returned rounding, usage, warnings, or provider metadata satisfy the fixed optionality/discriminator/integer contract.
- [ ] Do not send a live request merely to provoke an error. Typed error-envelope, status/type/code retry classification, ID, Retry-After, truncation, body-read, and safe-diagnostic behavior are release-required hermetic coverage in Chunks 06–07. A live error probe is outside this release and remains blocked until first-party documentation identifies a deterministic, non-secret request with a fixed status/envelope and acceptable billing/side-effect contract.
- [ ] Skip with a precise prerequisite message when credentials are absent or `AI_GATEWAY_LIVE_COST_ACK` is not exactly `I_ACCEPT_LIVE_EVALUATION_COSTS`; never fall back to a mock in this build-tagged test.
- [ ] Create `docs/evaluation-live-evidence.md` and record the execution date, model, upstream package versions, sanitized result shape, and any protocol drift before a release candidate. This Chunk 09 evidence file is the sole live-run record and must not depend on the Chunk 10 public guide existing.

**Acceptance checks:**

- [ ] `go test ./...` remains entirely hermetic and does not compile or execute the live contract package.
- [ ] `AI_GATEWAY_LIVE_COST_ACK=I_ACCEPT_LIVE_EVALUATION_COSTS go test -tags=livecontract ./internal/livecontract -run TestGatewayEvaluationContract` passes with an authorized credential already present in the environment.
- [ ] Captured output and CI artifacts contain no tokens, authorization headers, or unsanitized sensitive state/provider metadata.

### Chunk 10 — Public documentation and runnable evaluation example

**Commit boundary:** `docs: document evaluation SDK usage`

- [ ] Expand `README.md` with installation; the exact Go 1.26.0 minimum, maintained 1.26/1.27 support window, and pinned CI toolchains Go 1.26.8/1.27.1; experimental/version scope; exact endpoint distinction; all option acceptance/copy semantics; API-key/OIDC precedence and token-source per-attempt behavior; team/header/protected-header rules; nil-context behavior; status-200-only success and ignored response Content-Type; exact status-only retry predicate and type/code non-effect; retry policy units/defaults/bounds and duplicate-work warning; the five exact typed error names/accessor roles and closed `ConfigurationError`/`TransportError` values; feature matrix; and no-parity statement.
- [ ] Create `examples/evaluate/main.go` using `typesafe-ai/jev-latest`, one shared state, and boolean/choice/score questions with required instructions; read credentials only from environment and print typed answers plus safe structured metadata/error accessors without secrets or raw bodies.
- [ ] Create `docs/evaluation.md` with all request/answer invariants; the exact `ValidationError` and `ResponseValidationError` path grammars/reason vocabularies and field mappings; malformed/trailing/duplicate/unknown JSON behavior at every DTO level; status and Content-Type classification; absent/null/empty choice and score probability semantics; exact rounding/usage/warning/provider/response metadata optionality and wire semantics; every option's acceptance, normalization, defensive-copy, protected-header, credential/team/token-source behavior; exact `ConfigurationError.Option`/`Reason` and `TransportError.Operation` mappings; the exact status-only retry predicate and type/code non-effect; retry defaults/bounds/formula; all error accessor and zero-value semantics; provider options; validation failures; distinction from `/v1/evaluate`; and the sensitive nature of both raw-response diagnostic accessors and successful `ResponseMetadata.Body`. Examples and logging guidance must use safe structured error fields rather than raw bodies. Link it to the Chunk 09 `docs/evaluation-live-evidence.md` record, and update that record only for factual drift observed by the live run.
- [ ] Cross-link `docs/x-search.md` and explicitly distinguish direct xAI support from Gateway support.
- [ ] Ensure all exported identifiers have useful Go documentation, including exact `OptionalJSON`, metadata, `RetryPolicy`, and nil/zero error semantics and the warning on both `RawResponseBody` methods.

**Acceptance checks:**

- [ ] `go test ./...` compiles the example without executing a live call.
- [ ] `go vet ./...` succeeds.
- [ ] `go doc .` is sufficient to construct and call an evaluation client and independently determine every option acceptance/copy rule, response-decoding rule, metadata field, retry default/bound/unit, and error accessor/value/zero behavior.
- [ ] A reviewer can identify every supported and unsupported modality from the README table without reading source.

### Chunk 11 — CI and release readiness

**Commit boundary:** `ci: add module verification and release gates`
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with the exact pinned matrix Go 1.26.8 and Go 1.27.1, running ordinary tests only after explicitly unsetting `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`, `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN`, and `AI_GATEWAY_LIVE_COST_ACK`. Go 1.27.1 is the primary job and exclusively runs `go test -race ./...` and `go vet ./...`; both matrix versions run `go test ./...` and the example compile check. Updating either pin requires a reviewed plan/evidence update; floating `stable`, `oldstable`, `1.26.x`, or `1.27.x` selectors are not allowed in the initial release workflow. The ordinary suite's mandatory transport guard must reject non-loopback destinations; CI fails if the default Gateway regression request reaches DNS/network instead of that guard.
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/live-contract.yml` as manual/scheduled only and never for untrusted pull requests. Supply one authorized credential from CI secrets and set the job environment to the exact sentinel `AI_GATEWAY_LIVE_COST_ACK=I_ACCEPT_LIVE_EVALUATION_COSTS`; do not accept a repository, workflow-dispatch, or caller-provided acknowledgement value. This is the sole CI path allowed to contact non-loopback services.
- [ ] Add a dependency policy: standard library preferred; every new dependency requires rationale and license review.
- [ ] Confirm repository owner-selected `LICENSE` exists before any public tag.
- [ ] Document v0 release and migration policy in `README.md`: begin at `v0.x`; do not promise v1 compatibility while evaluation remains experimental; every exported breaking change, including during v0, requires a changelog entry, a release-note migration section naming removed/changed APIs and caller actions, and an appropriate version increment.
- [ ] Document bad-release policy: published tags are immutable and must never be moved, deleted as a rollback, or reused. Correct a defective release with a new patch version containing an appropriate `retract` directive for the bad version/range and rationale; mark the hosting release as affected, publish corrected release notes, and issue a security advisory when applicable.
- [ ] Complete all pre-tag release checks in this plan: clean hermetic CI with `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`, `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN`, and `AI_GATEWAY_LIVE_COST_ACK` unset; live evaluation contract pass with the exact acknowledgement sentinel; exported API review; clean local checkout consumer compile using a local `replace`; changelog/release notes including any v0 migration section; provenance configuration review; owner-selected license; and configured remote/repository metadata.
- [ ] Configure a remote and repository metadata outside code; record unresolved external prerequisites explicitly. Do not create any candidate tag in this chunk.

**Acceptance checks:**

- [ ] CI commands pass in a clean checkout with `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`, `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN`, and `AI_GATEWAY_LIVE_COST_ACK` unset and non-loopback requests rejected by the ordinary-test guard.
- [ ] The regression test proves the default Gateway host cannot be contacted by ordinary tests; loopback `httptest.Server` traffic still works.
- [ ] Live-contract workflow cannot expose secrets to forked pull requests and is the only workflow permitted external network access.
- [ ] A temporary clean consumer module outside the repository imports `gateway` through a local `replace`, constructs an evaluation call, initializes every exported request/metadata/retry struct, reads every public error accessor through `errors.As`, and compiles before tagging; it must fail review if `ConfigError`, exported retry hooks, or alternate compatibility aliases exist.
- [ ] License, remote, release notes/changelog, provenance, and other publication prerequisites are resolved; otherwise Chunk 12 tag creation remains explicitly blocked.
- [ ] Release documentation contains the immutable-tag, retraction/patch, advisory, and v0 breaking-change migration rules.

### Chunk 12 — Final integration verification and release candidate

**Commit boundary:** `chore: verify evaluation SDK release candidate`
- [ ] Audit every exported identifier against the supported-surface section and an API snapshot: require the exact metadata declarations, `RetryPolicy`, warning constants, and five error types/accessors; delete accidental abstractions, aliases (including `ConfigError`), exported hooks, fields, and unsupported promises.
- [ ] Re-check the pinned upstream `ai` and `@ai-sdk/gateway` versions and review provider source/tests for evaluation protocol drift. Update evidence and fixtures before code if drift exists.
- [ ] Run all hermetic verification commands below from a clean checkout with `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`, `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN`, and `AI_GATEWAY_LIVE_COST_ACK` unset.
- [ ] Run the credentialed evaluation live contract against `typesafe-ai/jev-latest` with `AI_GATEWAY_LIVE_COST_ACK=I_ACCEPT_LIVE_EVALUATION_COSTS`, verifying boolean/choice/score answers, warnings/usage/metadata handling, and required headers with sanitized captured evidence. Do not require or execute a live error-provoking request; typed failure behavior is proven hermetically and any future live error probe is blocked outside this release under Chunk 09.
- [ ] Confirm the documentation-only x_search decision remains complete and unsupported; the future blocked probe is outside this release and is not executed.
- [ ] Review README/docs/example against observed behavior and update only factual claims.
- [ ] Confirm every Chunk 11 pre-tag prerequisite is complete, then create and push a new immutable prerelease tag such as `v0.x.0-rc.1`; never move or reuse it.
- [ ] From a clean external consumer, first verify direct VCS resolution of the exact tag, then poll `GOPROXY=proxy.golang.org` until the exact tag resolves or a documented publication timeout expires. Compile the minimal consumer against the fetched tag and record sanitized provenance/checksum evidence.
- [ ] Only after tag and proxy verification succeeds, finalize or promote the release and publish release notes. A failed candidate remains immutable; correct it with a new version/tag under the bad-release policy.

**Acceptance checks:**

- [ ] Hermetic suite and race checks pass with `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`, `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN`, and `AI_GATEWAY_LIVE_COST_ACK` unset and non-loopback access denied.
- [ ] Evaluation live-contract smoke passes with the exact `AI_GATEWAY_LIVE_COST_ACK=I_ACCEPT_LIVE_EVALUATION_COSTS` sentinel, sanitized evidence, and no credential leakage.
- [ ] The pushed prerelease tag resolves from direct VCS and the public module proxy, and a clean consumer can import `gateway`, create a client, compile an evaluation call using all metadata/retry declarations, and use `errors.As` plus every documented accessor on all five exact error types.
- [ ] Published tag/proxy evidence postdates all Chunk 11 pre-tag gates; no checklist requires a tag before Chunk 12.
- [ ] No docs or exported API claim OpenAI `/v1`, language/streaming, full AI SDK parity, or Gateway native x_search support.

## Verification command inventory

Run these only in the implementation chunks that name them; this planning-only change does not execute them.
```sh
env -u AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY -u VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN -u AI_GATEWAY_LIVE_COST_ACK go test ./...
env -u AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY -u VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN -u AI_GATEWAY_LIVE_COST_ACK go test -race ./...
env -u AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY -u VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN -u AI_GATEWAY_LIVE_COST_ACK go vet ./...
env -u AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY -u VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN -u AI_GATEWAY_LIVE_COST_ACK go doc .
env -u AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY -u VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN -u AI_GATEWAY_LIVE_COST_ACK go test -run TestEvaluate ./...
AI_GATEWAY_LIVE_COST_ACK=I_ACCEPT_LIVE_EVALUATION_COSTS go test -tags=livecontract ./internal/livecontract -run TestGatewayEvaluationContract
```

`AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` and `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN` are the fixed production credential variables. `AI_GATEWAY_LIVE_COST_ACK` is the sole live-evaluation cost-acknowledgement variable, and `I_ACCEPT_LIVE_EVALUATION_COSTS` is its only accepted sentinel. Every ordinary-test command and CI job must unset all three variables explicitly. The live command requires exactly one authorized credential already present in its environment plus the sentinel assignment shown above. For pre-tag consumer verification in Chunk 11, create a temporary module outside the repository and use a local `replace`. After Chunk 12 creates and pushes the immutable prerelease tag, repeat from a fresh temporary module without `replace`: resolve direct VCS, resolve through `GOPROXY=proxy.golang.org`, compile the minimal caller, record sanitized evidence, and remove the temporary directory. Do not commit credentials, captured authorization headers, raw diagnostic bodies, or sensitive provider metadata.

## Release checklist
- [ ] All chunks 01–12 are `[x]`; the separate future x_search probe may remain `[!]` because it is outside the evaluation release.
- [ ] Upstream version/protocol evidence is current and cited.
- [ ] Hermetic, race, vet, and example checks pass in CI with `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`, `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN`, and `AI_GATEWAY_LIVE_COST_ACK` unset and ordinary non-loopback traffic rejected.
- [ ] Credentialed evaluation success-contract smoke passes with `AI_GATEWAY_LIVE_COST_ACK=I_ACCEPT_LIVE_EVALUATION_COSTS`; no live error-provoking request is a release prerequisite.
- [ ] README feature matrix and experimental/v0 status are accurate.
- [ ] License is selected by the owner and committed.
- [ ] Remote repository exists and module path matches it.
- [ ] Pre-tag API, local-consumer, changelog/release-note, migration, provenance, and publication checks completed before tag creation.
- [ ] A new immutable prerelease tag created in Chunk 12 is fetchable by direct VCS and from a clean consumer through the module proxy; failed tags are never moved or reused.
- [ ] Release notes list supported evaluation behavior, explicit non-goals, experimental risk, x_search unsupported status, and any required v0 migration steps.
- [ ] The bad-release procedure documents a new patch with `retract`, hosting-release marking, corrected notes, and an advisory when applicable.
- [ ] No secrets, raw diagnostic response bodies, or unsanitized live payloads are present in commits or artifacts.
